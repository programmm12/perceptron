This guide explains how to work with perceptron algorithms .
The code is written in Python.
In the perceptron, you deal with three main things: values (either 1 or 0, binary values), weights, and Perceptron inputs.
Firstly, you need to multiply lists, then sum up the new list.
After that, you require a function that operates between a single value and the new list. With this understanding, you can proceed to write the code for the perceptron.
